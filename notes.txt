Technology Used
- Python Flask Microframework for the backend.
- React for the frontend.
- Postgres for the database.
- Docker and docker-compose for the setup.

Folder structure:
- All backend code is in the folder named backend and all frontend code is the folder named frontend.

Running the Application:

A make file is provided at the root of the repository.
- Run "make server" to start the application, this will also in turn run make setup
- The API can be accessed at http://localhost:5000
- The frontend can be accessed at http://localhost:3000
- Run "make test" to run tests

Assumptions and decisions taken:
- Scope: I assumed that the scope did not include Auth and user management
- If the URL already exists in our database, we do not need to generate a new shortlink for it instead we return the existing short link.
- Shortlinks are not deleted or patched from the database
- Slugs can be 1 to 7 characters long
- Character set for the slug includes 1 - 9, a - z, A - Z
- Only http and https url schemes are allowed
- Setup shared will be run locally
- I also assumed hosting was not part of the scope.

I took a total of about 10 hours to complete the challenge, it had been a while without developing for the frontend.
